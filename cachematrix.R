## This provides wrapper functions to create a custom matrix .Additionally it has 
## routines which can compute  and  cache  its inverse lazily  , thus avoiding recomputation 

## Creates a custom inverse cacheable  matrix .Inout is a matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Computes the inverse of the matrix lazily 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
